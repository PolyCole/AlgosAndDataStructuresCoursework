# Kadane's Algorithm vs. Recursive Divide and Conquer
This assignment focused on observing the differences between kadane's algorithm and the recursive divide and conquer
algorithm when dealing with the maximum subarray problem. 
Since Kadane's algorithm runs in O(n) time, it will be faster than the recursive algorithm, as most iterative algorithms are.

This file is meant to be accessed through the command line where the input filename is passed in when the program is called.
The program will run each algorithm many times in order to obtain a more accurate average run time. Then, the program will
output the data into a file labled TimingOutput_[size of array].txt
