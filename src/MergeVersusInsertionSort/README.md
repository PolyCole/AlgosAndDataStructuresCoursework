#Merge Sort vs. Insertion Sort
This program compares Merge sort, a recursive divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with insertion sort, an iterative sorting 
algorithm. This program analyzes the differences in execution time as Merge sort usually runs in O(nlogn) while insertion
sort runs in, on average, O(n^2).
